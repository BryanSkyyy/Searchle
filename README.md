# Searchle React Frontend
Basically a Wordle x Where's Waldo fusion

This frontend is built with React and React-Router, with some bootstrap and other css for styling.

The frontend pulls the image for the day (currently updating every 10 minutes for testing) from a Node.js api backend, which is connected to a MongoDB
